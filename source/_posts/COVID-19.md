{% cq %}最近看COVID-19的疫情统计，发现WHO的统计数据总是落后于各地政府的数据，按理说这很正常，但{% endcq %}
<!-- more -->

WHO(World Health Organization 世界卫生组织) 从1月21号开始，每天于欧洲中部时间(Central European Time)24H以内的数据，迄今为止，已经发布了共计66个每日报告了。
Data as reported by national authorities by 10:00 CET
但即使对于同一天的统计数据，依旧比政府的统计数据落后不少，原因如下：

Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different data cutoff times are to be expected.
