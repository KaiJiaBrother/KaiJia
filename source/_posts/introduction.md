## My first blog
The domain name `kaijiadage.com` is derived from the Chinese spelling of my nickname which is widely used in my social media. I bought this domain name on Apirl 22nd 2016 and ran my own .net project on this website until the graduation of the undergraduate.
Regrettably, the server was expired after my graduation. As a result, the website cannot work.
When it comes to the beginning of semester 2 in my Msc study, I reborn the idea of setting up a personal blog in order to record my study, my life.
