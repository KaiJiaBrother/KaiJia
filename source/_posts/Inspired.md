> An email to record the concerns that I have recently. And thanks Professor Netta.
<!-- more -->
Dear Netta,

I'm still at leeds now,  in residence during this time. I don't have any plan to go back home in the near future.


-- Ok, thanks!

When I went shopping, I found only myself wearing the mask, which made me feel a little uncomfortable. Some of my Chinese friends suffered from discrimination maybe because they are Chinese and they wear the masks.

-- I also wore a mask yesterday and was also the only one in the shop and also got some funny looks. I think in general, we should expect a range of reactions. Some people think this is all crazy overreaction, others are down right panicking. If you experience any discrimination, please do let me know! Regardless, please don't put yourself at risk just because of other people's reactions.

I know self-control is pretty important, but when I study at home, I'm not very efficient. I tried to focus on the subjects that I'm interest in, maybe that's one of the solutions.

--Jerry, this is not going to be easy. Remember that we are planning on a marathon, not a sprint. I would not expect you to work full hours initially. You need to set yourself up and gradually create an environment and routine that work for you. Go easy on yourself. One step at a time...

-- take care! Netta

All the best to you and yours,
Jerry
