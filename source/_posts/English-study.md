# The difference between {% label warning@everyday %} and {% label primary@every day %}
- {% label warning@everyday %} is an `adjective` we use to describe something that's seen or used every day. It means `ordinary` or `typical`. `Everyday clothing`, then, refers to the ordinary clothes you wear on regular days, as opposed to outfits designated for special events or holidays. Occasionally, people use everyday as a noun—it’s a shorthand way of referring to their everyday routines.
- {% label primary@every day %} is a phrase that simply means `each day`. Because of the space separating the two words, 'every' is simply an adjective modifying the word 'day'.

- And if you want to know about his physical appearance, if he’s tall or short, fat or skinny, with a head full of dense, luxurious blond hair or bald as a billiard ball, you ask: {% label info@what does he/she look like %}.

# {% label primary@lack %} and {% label info@lack of %}?
- When {% label primary@lack %} is used as a `verb`, we do not use `of`. We just say {% label primary@lack %} followed by the thing that is missing or that there isn't enough of. Here are some more examples:
  - The project lacked funding, so it was canceled.
  - He lacks motivation to study.
  - I just started working, so I'm lacking experience.
- {% label primary@lack %} can ALSO be used as a `noun`! And when {% label primary@lack %} is used as a `noun`, then we do say {% label info@lack of %} + the thing that is missing or insufficient. Look at these examples of lack being used as a `noun`:
  - The project was canceled due to a lack of funding.
  - His lack of motivation to study results in bad grades.
  - I was disqualified from the job based on my lack of experience.
- Conclusion:
  - When using {% label primary@lack %} as a `verb`, it's followed directly by an object.
  - When using {% label primary@lack %} as a `noun`, we say {% label info@lack of %} + the object.

# {% label warning@do the shopping %} and {% label primary@go shopping %}?
- `To do the shopping` describes the regular process of going to the supermarket to buy food and the other necessary items we need to live on a day to day basis. There is an aspect of doing this regularly and it is more of an obligation than an enjoyable activity, for most.
- `To go shopping` means that your intentions are to buy things because you want to or because you need a new version of something. There isn't necessarily any routine aspect to this action.
