# IELTS CUE CARD – Talk about a person who taught you something important
- Who the person is? - mother
- What he/she is like? - never scolded me, encouraged me, positive attitude, patient, motivate me. an excellent cook
- What he/she taught you? - cooking, accompany her, washing all the stuff, stand beside her, have a try
- How you felt about him/ her? - grateful to her

I\'d like to talk about my mother, from whom I\'ve learned considerable knowledge. Out of diverse skills she taught me, I would focus on cooking.

She never scolded me and always encouraged me with a positive attitude. She is the most patient person I\'ve ever come across and even when I made some mistakes she continued to motivate me and turned my fears into cheers. Besides that, she is an excellent cook and I, of course, is lucky to enjoy different tasty dishes each day.

Ever since I made a plan to go abroad for my higher education, my mother started involving me in the kitchen with great patience, for I should look after myself without her being around.

Knowing that I had no idea of cooking and foods, she asked me to accompany her to the supermarket to get familiarized with various food. Then I was put in charge of washing all the stuff we bought for cooking and was made to stand beside her when she cooked, showing me how to do things. After a week\'s time, she left me to have a try, though I felt I was not ready. Encouraged and instructed by her, I made my first dish, although it was not as delicious as that made by my mother. Anyhow, I made it. My mother was much happier than I did, saying that I would surely be a good cook like her.

Busy with my study, I still cook when I\'m on a day off. Sometimes, I will try a different way to cook, and I\'d like to share my experience with mother about cooking, which she is eager to listen to and she is happy to try a new way, too. Learning to cook makes my life much easier and independent, and it\'s inevitable that I\'ll be able to use it for the rest of my life. So I feel grateful to my mother.

Follow Ups:
- What do you think is the best age for children to go to school?
From my perspective, the best age for children to go to school is around 6 years old because at that time, children's cognition and ability have reached a level that allows them to understand what the teachers are going to say in the class. That is also a period that children may have a lot of questions and they want the answers desperately. The subject that concludes a comprehensive knowledge goal may enable them to get these old questions done in a scientific way. In addition, children at 6 may have developed a good habit that they can sit patiently and quietly in the class and follow the classroom's regulations set by the teachers.
- Do you prefer to study by yourself or with friends?

I have always been interested in spending time with superior people because, in this way, I could learn new things from them and learn approaches to survive in this challenging world. I'd like to talk about one family member with whom I want to spend my quality time.

He is my grandfather. My grandfather is in his 70s. But he is still energetic and lively. He likes to do some outdoor activities, such as fishing and strolling.

He is a very extroverted and talktive person. He is a knowledgeable person, so I always take help in my studies. He was a history teacher before so he enjoys to tell the stories to others. My Grandfather gave excellent knowledge about our earlier history.

There are many reasons why I like to spend time with him. First of all, he always encourages me to face any challenge in my life. For example,
In addition, I like to share knowledge with him because he has excellent experience with their life; hence he always gives me the best advice and wishes to take notice from him.

Furthermore, He always supports me in every work, and he teaches me what thing is right or wrong for me. Apart from it, He has a whimsical nature, so sometimes he makes some fun. He gives me information about our history. Last but not least,


# Describe a difficult challenge that you completed/met
- What was the challenge? - an English speech contest, I agreed, benefits,  10 mins
- When and where did you complete/met it? - 2 years ago,
- Why was it difficult? - lack public speaking skills, be afraid of public speaking.
- How you felt about it? - became more confident

A difficult challenge that I completed was 2 years ago. One day, my English teacher asked me whether I'd like to take part in an English speech contest. I agreed cause I believed it was a good opportunity to enhance my oral English as well as develop the self-confidence.
The speech contest sounds really daunting to me, as I had to talk 10 minutes on the environment.
Actually, I lacked public speaking skills and was very afraid of public speaking.
I was quite comfortable when talking with my friends but when I had to talk in front of strangers especially judges, teachers and other students, I choked.

I was really worried and so I went to my teacher who regularly gave speeches in public for advice.
He told me that the key to a good speech is mastery over the subject matter.
So, I spent one whole week memorizing the content.
The next thing he told me to do was to divide the topic in different sections.
I divided my speech into five halves of 2 minutes each.
The first half was for introducing the topic and the last half for concluding the topic.
The remaining three halves were for the main content.
After breaking the speech into sections, I felt a lot more confident.
My friends also knew about my fear of public speaking and so every evening they used to come to my dormitory and help me prepare.
Slowly, I started feeling that it was doable.
I was nervous but I wasn’t worried anymore.

When finally, the day of the speech contest arrived, I not only gave the whole speech but also received the second prize for it.
My teacher told me that I did a really good job and he was pretty proud of me.
That is the day I realized that rather than fearing challenges we should welcome them.
Challenges not only make life more exciting but also more meaningful.
