Interest
{% endnote %}
- When it comes to playing the piano, that\'s absolutely my favorite.
I have been playing the piano since I was 4 years old and passed level 10 as a kid.
I was a part-time piano teacher & accompanist in Shanghai.

- In my spare time, I enjoy going hiking.
Most of the time, I prefer to go hiking on my own. I like to chat with strangers, meet new friends and listen to their stories.

- As for sports, I\'m a big fan of playing table tennis and badminton, sometimes jogging and cycling.

- I enjoy the books written by [Lin Ching-hsuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Ching-hsuan), [Ji Xianlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji_Xianlin) and [Shen Congwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Congwen).
